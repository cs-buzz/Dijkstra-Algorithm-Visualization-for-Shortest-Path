# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Visualization-for-Shortest-Path
Dijkstra Algorithm Visualization for Shortest Path with obstacles.

Based on [visualise-dijkstra](https://github.com/tanxh33/visualise-dijkstra) project, add some functions like setting up some obstacles on the path when finding the shortest path.
